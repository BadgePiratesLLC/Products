## LED Electronic Hourglass DIY Kit

This kit is an LED Hourglass that uses a tilt sensor to determine its
orientation.  When soldering any kit, it is generally a good idea to
start with the lowest height components and work your way up.  To power
the kit, we suggest taking something like an old mini/micro USB cable,
leaving the type A connector and clipping the remote end.  You can then
strip it back and use the Red (+) and Black (-) cables to solder to the
kit to power it.
