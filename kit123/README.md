## Single PCB LED Hourglass (no sensor)

###Kit 123

This kit is an LED Hourglass that uses an IC to display a pattern on
the LEDs.  When soldering any kit, it is generally a good idea to start
with the lowest height components and work your way up.  To power the
kit, we suggest taking something like an old mini/micro USB cable,
leaving the type A connector and clipping the remote end.  You can then
strip it back and use the Red (+) and Black (-) cables to solder to the
kit to power it.  You would do this in place of the black power jack
installation.  If you want to use that port, you can purchase a cable here:
