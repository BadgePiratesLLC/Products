## Badge Pirates Products

While we custom design a lot of our own products,  there are a lot of soldering kit projects available on the market that we felt might be of interest to some of our customers.  We have been curating them and making them available during events that we attend.

All of the kits that we sell we have completed a sample ourselves (or we will let you know if we haven't had the opportunity to yet) obviously needs instructions on how to put together.  The challenge with some of these kits is that the instructions might only be in Chinese or not very intuitive.  This site serves to be a reference for kits that we sell so you can put your project together.

If you have never soldered before, [this](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/) website is a great resource for getting started covering everything from technique to tools.
